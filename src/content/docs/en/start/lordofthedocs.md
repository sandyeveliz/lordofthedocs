LORD OF THE DOCS is a page made to help you find tutorials, documentation, blogposts, etc. about IT, about application development.

## Why?
We have all been in the situation where we are looking for tutorials, blogs, videos, etc. about a particular topic, some bug we can't solve, or we are just learning something new. But one of the big difficulties that exists today is that there is a lot of content (of all qualities) and we don't know which one to use or which one is the most updated, or which content creators are recommended to watch. And to be honest, it is not that there is a lack of content creators, but that there is a lack of an easier way to access them.

And that's where LORD OF THE DOCS comes in, the idea is to make a free website where we can all contribute and recommend blogs, videos, tweets (or X's ha) about anything and everything. 

## What topics it will cover
Here we will talk about everything that is IT (Information Technology or Information Technology), ie application development, but not just programming itself, but everything you need to be part of this beautiful field. You may have already seen it in the sidebar but you can contribute and share about:
- Front end
- Back end
- DevOps
- QA
- Product Managment
- UX/UI Design
- Security
- Other communication languages (English, German, etc.)

And all the others that maybe I can't think of right now that could help.

## How it is made

This first version was made with Astro Starlight, and why with this framework? For practicality, although we could do something much more complex with React, or Nextjs or Vue or Angular, and that would be more dynamic, with more possibility to customize interactions, add a db, etc etc etc etc. The truth is that it would take much longer and would require much more effort than this, use Astro Starlight that in itself is for documentation dev (by es or the docs in the title), has everything armed, no need to make routes, support mdx, i18n nothing, everything is already done ... which gives us the opportunity to focus on what is really important ... the content, start writing the Markdowns with content to start using it and if this is growing we will see what we do, if not this is enough as a great dictionary of content.
